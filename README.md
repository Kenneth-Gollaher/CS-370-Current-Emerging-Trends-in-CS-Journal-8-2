# CS-370-Current-Emerging-Trends-in-CS-Journal-8-2

## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
##### For this project, we were given code to a game called Treasure Hunt. Treasure Hunt is a pathfinding game using artificial intelligence. The agent is a pirate competing against the player. Using deep Q-learning, the agent needs to find the best and fastest path to the end goal. We were given starter code and needed to write code that represents the intelligent agent or pirate. The first class of code provided represents the environment called TreasureMaze.py. The second class of code provided stores the episodes, which is called GameExperience.py. The code that needed to be implemented was the deep Q-learnidng portion of the agent, which includes the game loop of the learning process.

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

### - What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
##### Computer scientists have a unique and important job. They provide a solution to complex problems, with the help of algorithms and software systems. They provide new types of software that can improve they way developers and designers use software systems. As technology advances, computer scientists can help make it easier to use for the end user. 

### - How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
##### As a computer scientist, I use a few strategies to solve and find a solution. Using the resources around me, I can effectively and efficiently find a solution to the problem I face. Having a logical and technical mindset, I can look at a problem a little differently and possibly can help me find that solution. I however am a team player and remain open minded to others opinions and ideas. 

### - What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
